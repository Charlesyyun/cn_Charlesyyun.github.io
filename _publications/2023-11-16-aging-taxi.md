Rapid population aging has significantly impacted labor supply and posed substantial challenges for the taxi industry, which have not yet been fully comprehended. Here, for the first time, we employ a large-scale dataset of taxi driver operations from China, establishing a comprehensive indicator system of taxi service performance, encompassing economic, environmental and safety aspects. Through the application of multivariate regression models and other statistical analysis techniques, we have thoroughly investigated the mechanisms through which aging influences taxi service performance. Our research reveals that older drivers, despite exhibiting higher operational efficiency and greater inclination towards stability, underperform in time efficiency metrics, such as income per hour worked, owing to a more conservative working style. Furthermore, aging manifests negative effects on safety and environmental performance. Adjusting driving strategies of older taxi drivers, such as regulating daily working hours and refining passenger-searching area preferences, can help mitigate these adverse impacts.
