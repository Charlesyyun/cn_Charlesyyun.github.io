This research aims to identify and analyze the significant risk factors contributing to accidents involving fishing vessels, a crucial step towards enhancing safety and promoting sustainable practices in the fishing industry. Using a data-driven Bayesian network (BN) model that incorporates feature selection through the Random Forest (RF) method, we explore these key factors and their interconnected relationships. A review of past academic studies and accident investigation reports from the Fisheries Mutual Insurance Association (FMIA) revealed 17 such factors. We then used the Random Forest model to rank these factors by importance, selecting 11 critical ones to build the Bayesian network model. The data-driven Bayesian Network (BN) model  is further utilized to delve deeper into the central factors influencing fishing vessel accidents. Upon validation, the study results show that the incorporating the Random Forest feature selection method enhances the simplicity, reliability, and precision of the BN model. This finding is supported by thorough performance evaluation and scenario analysis.
